Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: You'd want it to be manual so you are aware of what you are pulling into your local repository. And also it might impact what you are wokring on on your local repository.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

A:Forks are repository clones made from GitHub onto GitHub. You can fork a repository of another person and then clone it to you local to work on. This is helpful when you don't have access to the user's repository on GitHub.  Clones can be made of a local repository at another location on your system or clone a GitHub repository onto your local. Branch refers to only 1 repository.
