What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A git repository is created in which you can now commit versions. You need it to maintain version control. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Repository is a physical section present in the working directory in which we will save commits. Staging area step before making a commit, make sure we are commiting exactly what we want and then giving us a chance to add a commit message

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Git diff --staged would compare whats in the staging area to whats in the latest commit, this way you can see exactly what you are changing. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If you want to try out a new feature and not sure if it'll work out, you can do so without breaking the working version you've created till date, branch it out. 
You can also you it to create different versions of the same project with variations, and have different branches for all of them.
FOr example - different language, difficulty levels of a game, free and pro versions.
production value vs experimental/development

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
its like a tree diagram and has nodes, so a diagram makes is much easier to visualize and understand whats going on. 

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
the code in one branch merges with the other. If two different features/bugs are being worked on separately, they can be merged for 1 project. We represent it the way we do because its a new commit which contains al lthe code from both the branches.
